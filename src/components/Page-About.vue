  <p>
    Life stories inspire and connect us to each other.  And so many amazing life stories have been
    shaped by S.T.E.A.M. – like that of Leland Melvin.  Working in partnership with Leland, a retired
    astronaut and former NFL wide receiver, our website launches in conjunction with his memoir,
    Chasing Space.  We are proud to present Leland’s unique story as our first STEAMography.

  <p class="text-center">Transformative. Interactive. Personal.</p>

  <p>
    STEAMography encourages learning as exploration. Interactive stories reveal the influential role
    that S.T.E.A.M.-oriented education has played in Leland’s life. These real-life moments provide a way
    for kids to engage with S.T.E.A.M. in an inspirational context.  A strong portfolio of STEAMographies
    will help spark, develop, and reinforce their interest in S.T.E.A.M. topics.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of learning takes place in the midst of our life story – and the story of a life well lived
    inspires us all to keep learning.

    We are a dedicated group of ragtag misfits - artists, programmers, animators, poets, gardeners,
    adventurers, astronauts, geeks and foodies - who believe passionately that we can change the world –
    one STEAMography at a time.
